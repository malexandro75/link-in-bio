# First HTML Project  (LinkTree Styled Page)

Welcome to my Linktree style landing page. I included links to my social media profiles and the main pages to three popular platforms. 

## My Social Media Profiles
- Github
- LinkedIn
- Instagram

## Three Links to Main Pages of Social Media
- Instagram
- TikTok
- GitHub

### Reflection 
This is the first time that I have ever coded using HTML.
I made sure to code and not copy to learn the way the code blocks work. I used the links as I progressed to see what was wrong with my code. I also used the W3 resource to find syntax error. 
I found out that many times when I refreshed my page it would match because I was missing ">". This tool helped me analyze my code to see what I missed.
